Java Development Fellowship @ Oasis Infobyte

This repository showcases the projects I completed as part of my Java Development Fellowship at *Oasis Infobyte*. Each task reflects foundational concepts in backend development using Java.

Task 1: 

🎯 Number Guessing Game – Java Project
"Guess the Number" is a fun and beginner-friendly Java console game where the player tries to guess a number randomly generated by the computer. It’s a great mini-project to practice Java fundamentals like loops, conditionals, input handling, and random number generation.

🧠 How It Works
The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user is prompted to guess the number.

After each guess, the system provides feedback:

Too high 🔺

Too low 🔻

Correct ✅

The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

🛠️ Features
🎲 Random number generation

🎯 Real-time feedback for each guess

🔢 Input validation and user interaction

⏱️ Optional Add-ons:

Limit number of attempts

Multiple rounds of play

Scoring system based on performance

Points awarded based on number of attempts

📂 Technologies Used

Java (Core)

Scanner for input

Random class for number generation

Loops & conditionals
